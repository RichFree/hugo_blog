This is my first post in hugo!

<!--more-->

It took me a couple of weeks learning from
[this](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/build-websites-with-hugo/) resource,
and a really nice and well laid-out
[theme](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) that allowed me to replicate
most of what I did in my Jekyll blog. 

I found Hugo to be a really pleasant static-site generator to learn and use. The
Hugo binary is much easier to install compared to the ruby tools and
dependencies that I have to install to set-up Jekyll. 

But one of the main reasons why I decided to switch to Hugo was because of the
tools available to use R Markdown with Hugo. There is
[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and
[hugodown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/) that helps to tie what I do in my
Statistics work, which is mostly done in R, to this blog.

Not only that, I also plan to include these features in the coming days:

* Publishing Jupyter Notebooks as posts in the blog
* using KaTeX in some form to recap some of the mathematical foundations of my
  Stats course
* Including rich content using shortcodes (think embedded YouTube videos!)
* RSS (It might already be working)
* Search-Engine Optimizations
* Search (perhaps users can just Ctrl + F on the archives page for now)

I'm looking forward to a blog that is going to be filled with more of what I do
on a weekly basis rather than just my early Linux-only content!
