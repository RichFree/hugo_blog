This is my very first post. It took quite a while for me to get here, but
finally, I have published something! 

<!--more-->

I have always wanted to make a simple text-based site ever since I saw this
[video](https://youtu.be/OWAqilIVNgE). It just never occured to me that in the
length of that video (18:37), it was possible to setup a basic html website, and
even with HTTPS. I just wanted to try to see if it was really that easy, and it
really was! When I saw my first "hello-world" html webpage on a localhost link,
I got really excited! 

But with that tiny accomplishment, I wanted more. I realised I was tinkering
with quite a bit of stuff in my free time and have quite a bit of thoughts and
guides that I wrote for myself. I was even sharing some of these with my
friends, but even then, I still felt that I was just exploring for the sake of
exploring and not going anywhere. But I chanced upon
[this](https://shinglyu.com/) blog and it inspired me to catalog and publish
what I've been learning in my spare time. And so with some late nights, and
meeting a couple of dead ends, I finally have a working platform to publish my
thoughts! 

I envision this blog to be a collection of things that I have learned, first as
a guide to friends and strangers who might retrace the steps that I have took,
and also as a reminder to myself of where I started from and the journey that I
had taken.
