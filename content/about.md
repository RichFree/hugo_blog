My name is Richard. 

I am currently an undergraduate in NUS that is majoring in Statistics with a
specialization in Data Science. 

I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science. 

## What is my work? 

I am a Statistician - give me a dataset and I will explore the data, visualize
it, ask some questions and give you, hopefully, a robust model with sane
assumptions you can use to make decisions. 

## What are my interests?

I love technology. Not the "what's the next iPhone" kind of technology, but the
Anandtech kind of technology. Seeing hardware get faster, smaller, and more
efficient on a regular basis makes me excited.

I also love the software side of tech. I am an ardent believer of free and open
source software. I try to use more free alternatives if I can help it. And yes,
I use GNU/Linux as my main OS of choice. 

I like to get lost in my thoughts sometimes (responsibly of course), and that
sometimes takes the form of journaling my thoughts, and this blogging thing
could perhaps be an outlet for some of these thoughts from the unknown abyss of
my mind.
